      <h1>About the Author</h1>
      <p> My name is Greg Bassett. I am a Chemistry major and Data Science minor at the University of Rhode Island. I am taking this course
      <br> to advance my knowledge in the world of Computer Science, a field that I hope will be an integral part of my career
      when I graduate from school. I enjoy spending my free time riding my bike and following
      my favorite hockey team, the Boston Bruins. I also spend a majority of my time working in a restaurant as a waiter.
